**Title**: Performances of functional diversity indices to randomized Poisson and binomial data distributions serving as simulations of sampling errors in species abundances

**Abstract**: Functional diversity indices are a staple to the research of ecology and evolutionary biology. New advances are made when researchers publish innovative formulae that capture different aspects of a communityâ€™s functional diversity. This independent project investigates the performances of five different functional diversity indices when they are confronted with randomized Poisson and binomial data distributions. The five indices chosen are community weighted mean, functional dispersion, functional richness, functional evenness, and Shannon diversity. The randomized data distributions serve as simulations of field sampling errors in species abundances. This research utilized a field-collected dataset of species abundances and functional trait values in a grassland environment. True, original values of the functional diversity indices were calculated using the nonmanipulated dataset. Randomizations of Poisson and binomial distributions were employed to manipulate the dataset and to replicate field sampling errors in species abundances. Errant values of the functional diversity indices were then calculated using the manipulated dataset. Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests revealed that the simulated Poisson and binomial distributions of community weighted mean were not statistically different from the expected distributions. The goodness-of-fit tests also showed that the simulated Poisson and binomial distributions of the other four indices were statistically different from their expected distributions. The data analysis suggests that community weighted mean is the most robust of all the chosen functional diversity indices as its simulated distributions did not deviate from its expected distribution to a significant degree. As such, future researchers should prioritize using community weighted mean above functional dispersion, functional richness, functional evenness, and Shannon diversity.
